Data is generated by using neural networks to attack the adversarial reinforcement learning framework (ENHANCED ADVERSARIAL STRATEGICALLY-TIMED ATTACKS AGAINST DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING)

DDPG algorithm is used to achieve human-like handshake and high-five task through special reward function setting(Demonstration-Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning of Control Policies for Dexterous Human-Robot Interaction)

MLP was used to build the model of the soft manipulator, and DDPG algorithm was used to control the soft manipulator(Position Control of Cable-Driven Robotic Soft Arm
Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning)

DDPG algorithm and its extension are used to implement a series of operations on objects with variable shape(Sim-to-Real Reinforcement Learning for Deformable Object Manipulation)
